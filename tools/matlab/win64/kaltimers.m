%   KALTIMERS returns the list of timers currently registered with the core DSP library
%   in the order they are due to fire, with details of what routine will be called 
%   and the offset from the previous timer (with the exception of the first timer, 
%   which will show an absolute timeout).
%
%   NOTE: if the DSP is running when this is called, it will be stopped, the
%   required data will be read and then the DSP will be restarted.
%
%   KALTIMERS( FILENAME ) passes FILENAME to KALLOADSYM to load an ELF or KLO file and
%   then returns the timer information.
