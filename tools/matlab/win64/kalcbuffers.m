%   KALCBUFFERS ( ) prints the status of the cbuffers in Kalimba. It requires the
%   structures follow the naming convention '*cbuffer_struc'.
%
%   [ BUFFERS ] = KALCBUFFERS ( ) returns the status of the cbuffers in Kalimba.
%   Each buffer structure has the following fields:
%       name                The name of the cbuffer
%       readPointer         The current read pointer value
%       writePointer        The current write pointer value
%       size                The size of the cbuffer, in addressable units.
%       startAddress        The start address of the cbuffer
%       availableSpace      The available space in the cbuffer, in addressable units.
%       availableData       The number of addressable units of data available to read from the cbuffer.
%
%   [ BUFFERS ] = KALCBUFFERS( FILENAME ) passes FILENAME to KALLOADSYM to load an ELF or 
%   KLO file and then prints or returns the status of the cbuffers in Kalimba.
%
%   See also kalloadsym, kalsymfind, kalreadval, kalwriteval, kalrunning.

% If we've been passed an argument, assume it's a filename from which to load symbols.
