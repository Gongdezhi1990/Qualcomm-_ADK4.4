% KALBREAK( ADDR, BREAKPOINT_ID ) sets the specified hardware PM breakpoint
% to ADDR.
%
% If BREAKPOINT_ID is not specified, 0 is assumed.
%
% There is 1 hardware PM breakpoint on BC3, 4 on BC5, and 8 on BC7/8 and newer chips.
%
% Passing an ADDR of -1 will disable that hardware PM breakpoint.
%
% If BREAKPOINT_ID is also -1, this will disable all hardware PM breakpoints.
%
% If ADDR is a string it is treated as a hexadecimal value, unless
% it is ''help'', which displays this message.
