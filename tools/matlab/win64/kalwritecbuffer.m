%   N = KALWRITECBUFFER( NAME , DATA , FORMAT) writes the words in vector DATA to
%   the cbuffer structure specified in NAME. The format is given in FORMAT; valid values 
%   for FORMAT correspond to those for the kalwriteval function.
%   If FORMAT is not specified, the default format is the same as for kalwriteval.
%   If the amount of data is larger than the available space, KALWRITECBUFFER
%   only writes as much as possible. The number of words written to the cbuffer is
%   returned in N.
