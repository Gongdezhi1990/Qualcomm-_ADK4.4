/*! @file pio.h @brief Access BlueCore I/O lines
**
**
BlueCore variants from BlueCore2 onwards have twelve Programmable Input/Output(PIO)
pins and a further three or four pins (dependent on BlueCore variant) may
be available if they are not being used as AIO pins.
**
Some BlueCore variants from BlueCore5-MM onwards have 16 PIO pins and
can also control some of the chips UART/PCM lines by mapping them in
as PIO pins 16 and greater. Mapping a UART/PCM line as a PIO line stops
the line performing its original function, so these lines should only be
used as PIOs when these interfaces are not required.
**
Attempts to configure the upper 16 PIOs will be rejected if these
pins have not been mapped first.
**
Persistent Store keys may be set to hand control of certain PIO pins over
to the BlueCore firmware. Examples include PSKEY_USB_PIO_WAKEUP, PSKEY_USB_PIO_DETACH,
PSKEY_USB_PIO_PULLUP and PSKEY_USB_PIO_VBUS.
In such configurations the VM should not attempt to use these pins.
**
Various other hardware and software configurations make use of specific PIO pins.
Examples include
- Pio[1:0] Used to control external hardware on Class 1 modules.
- Pio[7:6] Used for I2C.

  @brief Configure PIO monitoring.

  @param mask Bitmask indicating which pins to monitor. Setting this
    to zero disables PIO monitoring.
  @param count How many times the monitored pins' state must be
    observed to be consistent before it is considered stable. Zero and
    one have special significance. If \e count is 1, then no
    debouncing is performed - any perceived change of the pins will
    raise the event. If \e count is 0, any transition raises the
    event, even if no change in pin state can be detected; in this
    case, the "state" members of #MessagePioChanged may show no change
    in state.
  @param period The delay in milliseconds between successive reads of
    the pins.
  @return A 32 bit mask. If any bit in this mask is high then
    monitoring could not be set up for that PIO; no action will have
    been taken on any PIOs (any previously set up monitoring will
    remain in force). The most likely reasons for a non-zero return
    are attempting to debounce nonexistent PIOs, or attempting to
    debounce unmapped PIOs. See the PioSetMapPins32() documentation
    for information on which PIOs can be mapped.

  This function configures a simple debounce engine for PIO input
  pins. It can detect transitions on PIOs and return stabilised
  readings for them, filtering out glitches.

  When the engine detects a change in state of one or more of the
  monitored pins, it repeatedly reads the pin state. If the state of
  all the monitored pins remains unchanged for \e count successive
  samples, it is considered stable and a #MESSAGE_PIO_CHANGED message
  is sent to the task registered with MessagePioTask().

  \note
  It is not possible to configure different debounce settings for
  different pins or groups of pins, or to debounce pins independently
  of each other.

  Examples:

  To enable events on PIO2 and PIO3, with 4 reads 2ms apart (6ms
  total):

  \code
  PioDebounce32(1u<<2 | 1u<<3, 4, 2);
  \endcode

  To enable events on any transition on PIO5 with no debouncing:

  \code
  PioDebounce32(1u<<5, 1, 0);
  \endcode

  BlueCore has internal resistors which can be configured to either pull-up or 
  pull-down the pins used for input. This is controlled by the value 
  written to the output register using PioSet32().
  The resistors pull-down if the value is zero, and pull-up otherwise, so the 
  following fragment sets pins 1 and 2 to inputs with pin 1 configured to 
  pull-up and pin 2 configured to pull-down.

  For BC5-MM the PIO lines map to other pins as follows:

  (PIO 0..15) have no mapping. They are always PIO 0..15. They can be 
  configured as inputs or outputs.

  (PIO 16) maps to PCM_DATA. This can be configured as an input or an output.

  (PIO 17) maps to PCM_SYNC. This can be configured as an input or an output.

  (PIO 18) maps to UART_DATA_OUT. This can be configured as an input or an 
  output.

  (PIO 19) maps to PCM_CLK_OUT. Set this to output to the PCM_CLK pin. This 
  line is output only. Note that the PCM_CLK pin direction shadows PCM_SYNC 
  direction and ignores directions set via PioSetDir32().

  (PIO 20) maps to AIO0. Mapping this PIO will overwrite the value set in 
  PSKEY_AMUX_AIO0. Unmapping this PIO will restore the value set in 
  PSKEY_AMUX_AIO0. Note that on BC5-MM configuring AIO lines as PIO lines is 
  not recommended due to the low voltage level.

  (PIO 21) maps to AIO1. Mapping this PIO will overwrite the value set in 
  PSKEY_AMUX_AIO1. Unmapping this PIO will restore the value set in 
  PSKEY_AMUX_AIO1. Note that on BC5-MM configuring AIO lines as PIO lines is 
  not recommended due to their low voltage level.

  PIO lines above 21 map to nothing and cannot be mapped or written. 

  For CSR8670 the PIO lines map to other pins as follows:

  (PIO 0..12) have no mapping. They are always PIO 0..12.
  They can be configured as inputs or outputs.
  The smaller packages such as Chip Scale Package (CSP) does not have PIO8..12.

  (PIO 13..15) may be mapped if required. The exact signal routing is dependent
  on which package is being used. On smaller packages, such as CSP, you must
  map PIO13-15 if you want PIO instead of UART UART_RX, UART_TX and UART_CTS.
  On the BGA package PIO13..15 have their own pins, but if mapped, will be 
  connected to the UART_RX, UART_TX and UART_CTS pins as well. Whether mapped
  or not, these PIO pins may be configured as inputs or outputs. For each pin,
  if mapped and set as output, both (UART and PIO) pins are driven. If mapped
  and set as input, the UART pin is connected and the PIO pin is n/c.

  (PIO 16) maps to the UART_RTS pin. This can be configured as an input or an
  output.

  (PIO 17) maps to the PCM_IN pin. This can be configured as an input or an
  output.

  (PIO 18) maps to the PCM_OUT pin. This can be configured as an input or an 
  output.

  (PIO 19) maps to the PCM_SYNC pin. This can be configured as an input or an 
  output.

  (PIO 20) maps to the PCM_CLK pin. This can be configured as an input or an 
  output.

  (PIO 21) maps to the SQIF Flash Clock pin. This can be configured as an input
   or an output.

  (PIO 22) maps to the SQIF RAM Clock pin. This can be configured as an input
  or an output.  
  
  (PIO 23) maps to the SQIF Flash CS pin. This can be configured as an input
  or an output.  
  
  (PIO 24) maps to the SQIF RAM CS pin. This can be configured as an input or
  an output.

  (PIO 25) maps to the SQIF DB0 pin. This can be configured as an input or an 
  output.

  (PIO 26) maps to the SQIF DB1 pin. This can be configured as an input or an 
  output.
  
  (PIO 27) maps to the SQIF DB2 pin. This can be configured as an input or an 
  output.
  
  (PIO 28) maps to the SQIF DB3 pin. This can be configured as an input or an 
  output.

  PIO lines above 28 map to nothing and cannot be mapped or written.

  supported for each PIO pins.

  A pin can support only few functions. Trying to set a function 
  which is NOT supported by the pin will return FALSE without 
  affecting/modifying the existing pin function.

  If a pin supports only two functions i.e., PIO/UART_RX then 
  PioSetMapPins32() is sufficient to map the pin as UART_RX/PIO.
  See the PioSetMapPins32() documentation for more information.
  
  if a pin supports more than two functions and currently, it is 
  mapped to a pio line, then pin should be unmapped using 
  PioSetMapPins32() and then set the supported function for the 
  corresponding pin by calling PioSetFunction().

  PioSetFunction() Usage Example:
  if PIO[3] can be mapped to UART_RX/PCM_IN/PIO and 
  currently PIO[3] is mapped as PIO, then VM App should call the 
  PioSetMapPins32() to unmap it from PIO and then call 
  PioSetFunction() to map to (UART_RX/PCM_IN) function.

  Unmap PIO[3] so that it can be mapped to a function
  PioSetMapPins32(1<<3, 0<<3);

  This will map PIO[3] line as UART_RX
  PioSetFunction(3, UART_RX);  

  To map back the PIO[3] as a PIO, PioSetMapPins32() should be used.
  PioSetMapPins32(1<<3, 1<<3);
