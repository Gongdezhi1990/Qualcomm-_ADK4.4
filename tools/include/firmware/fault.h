  @brief Reads the last fault code and *can* clear it.
  @param clear_fault Value TRUE to clear the last fault code after reading it,
  otherwise FALSE.
  @return The last fault code.

  @note
  The fault code is not cleared at boot-up (due to soft reset or hard reset).
  Therefore, the VM application can get stale value from power-on or repeated
  value over multiple power cycles if it was not cleared after boot-up.

  When PSKEY_PANIC_ON_FAULT is set to TRUE, BlueCore system will
  panic immediately when any fault condition is encountered.
  VmGetResetSource call would return reset source as RESET_SOURCE_FIRMWARE.
  VM application can read the fault code and panic code to find the 
  reset reason.
