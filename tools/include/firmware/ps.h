@brief Access to persistent store.
**
A user application running on the VM can access the persistent store on
BlueCore which provides a small amount of non-volatile storage.
**
Up to one hundred and fifty keys can be used, 0 to 149. There are no predefined
meanings for these keys; they can be used for any purpose required by the user
application. However, the total amount of data associated with all the keys
should be kept as small as possible, at most 1024 words.
**
These keys are divided into three blocks of equal size and function
- User configuration data (0 to 49).
- DSP configuration (50 to 99).
- VM Connection Library data (100 to 149) NOTE: Applications MUST NOT use these.
**
The first twenty-five in both blocks, 0 to 24 and 50 to 74, are protected
against upload and modification via DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade) unless
accompanied by a valid signature. Hence, they should be used for sensitive data
such as cryptographic keys.
**
The maximum length of persistent store key that is guaranteed to be supported by
the BlueCore firmware and its supporting tools is 64 words. Attempts to use
longer persistent store keys may return failure or may cause undefined firmware
behaviour.
**
@par Notes
The persistent store is normally held in flash memory. This means that only a
finite number of changes can be made to values held in persistent store without
performing a defragment of the flash. The defragment is a time and memory
intensive operation that is only performed at boot time. Hence the number of
changes to the value of a key should be kept to a minimum. If the return code
from PsStore() indicates a failure then the chip needs to be reset for a
defragment to occur. To control when defragmentation occurs, use PsFlood() and
BootSetMode().  When persistent store is held in EEPROM, write operations to
EEPROM are time consuming. So during Bluetooth activity, avoid back-to-back
multiple PSKEY reads and writes since this may cause undefined firmware
behaviour.
**
@par Notes
Doing error checks on a key's value costs code space and usually has no
effect. If the value of a key gives an error then it should be detected while the
module is being designed (or by the tools if you have simple keys) and so the
error checking is redundant in the field. The only exception is where it's
possible to set a key in such a way that the chip doesn't boot. In this case,
the user may be unable to recover the module once they've set the key. In this
case, you may want to consider issuing a fault and falling back to sane values
if the key is wrong.  It may be worth considering overriding certain settings
depending on other keys as a way of avoiding synchronised settings.  If you end
up overriding a whole key then the key is redundant and can be removed. If you
override part of a key, say a bit fielded key, then it costs little code to
simply apply a mask to the value read from persistent store and then set bits
later.

  @brief Copy the specified memory buffer to persistent store.
  @param key The persistent store key to copy data to.
  @param buff The memory buffer to copy data from.
  @param words The number of words to copy.

  @return The number of words actually written. Zero if either 'words' is zero
    or the store failed.

  A Persistent store user key can be deleted by calling the PsStore function
  with \e key to be deleted and \e words argument being zero.

  \note
  The key is interpreted as an index into PSKEY_USR0,
  ... PSKEY_USR49, PSKEY_DSP0 ... PSKEY_DSP49, PSKEY_USR50 ... PSKEY_USR99.
  No other keys can be written from an application.

  \note
  What \e buff can point to is currently restricted to regular RAM
  areas (globals, stack, and slots); a call to PsStore() where \e buff
  points into the area returned by SourceMap(), for example, will
  likely panic the application. This is not expected to be a common
  use of PsStore(); in the unlikely event that it causes a problem,
  the application can indirect via a bounce buffer that's come from
  malloc() or the stack.

  \note
  If the VM application uses the VM software watchdog functionality, BlueCore 
  firmware automatically extends the VM software watchdog before copying the 
  memory buffer value to persistent store. This is only applicable if the
  PsStore type is EEPROM since EEPROM writes are time consuming.
  This ensures that the VM application is given enough time to kick
  the VM software watchdog once the PS write to EEPROM is completed.

  Note that this uses full CSR PS key numbering, not the
  0..99 space used by the other Ps functions which are restricted to
  accessing the VM and DSP specific keys.

  If a key is present (has a value) in any store (e.g., ROM, factory),
  stores layered on top of that (e.g., EEPROM, RAM) cannot cause the key
  to be absent. Therefore, making some behaviour conditional on the absence
  of a key is something to be avoided if at all possible. If the key has a
  default value in ROM, your behaviour will be impossible to access.

  Note that you can override any value with a zero-length value,
  so testing for a zero-length value does not have this problem.
  Usually this means you can obey this rule by allowing a zero length key
  to behave the same as an absent key.

  The correct way to read a key which may be a zero length pskey may 
  will look like below
      uint16 pio = 0xffff;
      if (PsFullRetrieve(PSKEY_*., &pio, sizeof(pio)) && pio <= 15)
         {
            // enable feature using the PIO pin in pio
         }
  The initialisation of pio gives the value if the key isn't present,
  PsFullRetrieve returns FALSE if the key doesn't exist.
