  @brief Returns TRUE if VREG_EN(_H) is raised.

  This is only supported on BlueCore variants with charger hardware. 
  On BlueCore variants prior to BC5 this must be polled if we wish to 
  detect if the level of VREG_EN(_H) has changed. On BlueCore variants 
  from BC5 onwards changes in the VREG_EN(_H) level can generate events;
  See MessageChargerTask documentation for details.

  (Typically an ON/OFF button is wired to VREG_EN.  When the button is
  pressed, VREG_EN goes high, the chip powers up, and the firmware
  latches the SMPSU regulator as part of the early boot sequence.
  VREG_EN can then be removed. To turn off the chip using the same
  button we need to have visibility of VREG_EN.)

    Various BlueCore models have different numbers and types of power supplies/ regulators.

    BlueCore models. Consult the datasheet for your BlueCore variant for more information.
