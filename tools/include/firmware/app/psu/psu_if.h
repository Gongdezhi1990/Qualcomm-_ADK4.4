    Definitions for the psu subsystem.

DESCRIPTION
    This file is seen by the stack, and VM applications, and
    contains things that are common between them.

 @file psu_if.h
 @brief Parameters for use in the PsuConfigure VM trap.

 The various psu_id values allow the VM application to disabled the switchmode
 power supplies and linear regulators on BlueCore. The exact number and type of
 power supplies on BlueCore, as well as their intended purpose, vary between
 different BlueCore variants. Consult the datasheet of your BlueCore variant
 for more details.

 Example : PsuConfigure(PSU_SMPS0, PSU_ENABLE, 1); Enable Switchmode power supply0
 Example : PsuConfigure(PSU_ALL, PSU_ENABLE, 0); Shut down all PSUs
