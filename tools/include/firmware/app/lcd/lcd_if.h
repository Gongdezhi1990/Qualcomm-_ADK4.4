 @brief Parameters for LcdConfigure() and LcdSet().
**
**
 Some BlueCore variants have a dedicated LCD block which may be routed to
 PIO pads. This routing is controlled by the VM trap PioSetLcdPins().
 After PioSetLcdPins() has been successfully called, the LCD segments may be
 turned on/off using the VM trap LcdSet().

 It is not necessary to map pins using PioSetMapPins32() - this is handled by
 PioSetLcdPins().

 Consult the datasheet for your BlueCore variant to identify precisely how
 the LCD segments are internally connected to which PIOs.

    #LCD_CLK_DIV is a 4-bit value used to set the LCD block's internal clock
    divide ratio, to enable a wide range of LCD parts to be accommodated.

     Value1 is a 4-bit value, this gives the following range of possible

    mask32 = bitwise representation of PIOs that need writing, where b31=PIO31
    thru b0 = PIO0. Only *segments* (not the common) that have been
    successfully routed to PIOs using PioSetLcdPins(..) may be set here.
    value32 = bitwise representation of PIOs' values. b31=PIO31, b0=PIO0.
    Use a 1 to enable the segment, a 0 to turn it off.
    Only those bits set in mask32 are acted upon.
    If the Trap call was successful it returns result32 = 0. Otherwise it
    returns erroneous bits and no action is performed.
