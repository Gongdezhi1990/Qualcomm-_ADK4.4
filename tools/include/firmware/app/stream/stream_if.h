  @brief Keys used with SinkConfigure().

  The VM_SINK_USB_ keys are used to change certain properties associated
  with the USB bulk endpoint, intended primarily to allow the behaviour
  of bulk transfers to be configured in a manner suitable for use by a
  USB mass storage application. Other types of application will probably
  want to leave everything at its default value.
  A USB mass storage application would set the 
  following keys at initialisation:
    VM_SINK_USB_TERMINATION = 1
    VM_SINK_USB_VM_SUPPLIES_LENGTH = 1
    VM_SINK_USB_SUPPORT_LARGE_FILES = 1
  The application would then provide the length of data
  before each transfer:
    VM_SINK_USB_TRANSFER_LENGTH = data_length
  NB: VM_SINK_USB_TERMINATION must be set from the VM _init function
  and the termination type can not be changed later.

    STREAM_PCM_ keys are used to configure the audio PCM hardware obtained by
    invoking the StreamAudioSource()/StreamAudioSink() traps with #AUDIO_HARDWARE_PCM
    as the "hardware" parameter.

    STREAM_I2S_ keys are used to configure the audio I2S hardware obtained by
    invoking the StreamAudioSource()/StreamAudioSink() traps with #AUDIO_HARDWARE_I2S
    as the "hardware" parameter.

    STREAM_CODEC_ keys are used to configure the audio CODEC hardware obtained by
    invoking the StreamAudioSource()/StreamAudioSink() traps with #AUDIO_HARDWARE_CODEC
    as the "hardware" parameter.

    STREAM_FM_ keys are used to configure the audio FM hardware obtained by
    invoking the StreamAudioSource()/StreamAudioSink() traps with #AUDIO_HARDWARE_FM
    as the "hardware" parameter.

    STREAM_SPDIF_ keys are used to configure the audio SPDIF hardware obtained by
    invoking the StreamAudioSource()/StreamAudioSink() traps with #AUDIO_HARDWARE_SPDIF
    as the "hardware" parameter.

    STREAM_DIGITAL_MIC_ keys are used to configure the audio digital MIC hardware obtained by
    invoking the StreamAudioSource() trap with #AUDIO_HARDWARE_DIGITAL_MIC
    as the "hardware" parameter.

    STREAM_AUDIO_ keys are used to configure the audio hardware obtained by
    invoking the StreamAudioSource()/StreamAudioSink() traps with any kind of the #audio_hardware.

    STREAM_FASTPIPE_ keys are used to configure FastPipes.
