 @brief Configuration parameters for LED control
 **
 **
 Some BlueCore variants (usually headset parts) have dedicated LED pads.
 In addition to simple ON/OFF controls, some BlueCore variants have hardware
 support for dimming and/or flashing these LEDs. The LEDs are configured using
 a key/value system with the LedConfigure() VM trap.

 Consult the datasheet for your BlueCore variant to identify how many LED pads
 it supports.

    /*!
LED_PERIOD controls the PWM period. Valid values with this key range from 0..0xF.
pwm_period is calculated as follows:

pwm_period = clock_period * 4096 * 2^LED_PERIOD

Where clock_period is 1/26MHz for CSR8670/CSR8610 and 1/16MHz for earlier.

CSR8670/CSR8610:  The resultant range of values is 157uS...5.162S at all times.
There is a normalisation adjustment that checks that
LED_FLASH_RATE >= LED_PERIOD. The normalisation check will increase
LED_FLASH_RATE if necessary, and occurs whenever LED_PERIOD is configured.
The normalisation adjustment can be circumvented by configuring LED_PERIOD 
before configuring LED_FLASH_RATE.

Pre-CSR8670/CSR8610:  The resultant range of values is 256us...8.39s when
BlueCore is running at full speed. The clock period will be longer when
BlueCore is in shallow or deep sleep.

Set the rate to flash/pulse LED. Valid values to use with
this key range from 0..0xF.

LED_FLASH_RATE sets the flash pulse period as a multiple of pwm_period.

Led Flash Rate is calculated as follows:

Led Flash Period = pwm_period * 96 * 2^LED_FLASH_RATE

Where pwm_period is as calculated above.

And so, LED_FLASH_RATE maps to a multiplier as follows.

LED_FLASH_RATE = 0:     Led Flash Period = pwm_period * 96

LED_FLASH_RATE = 1:     Led Flash Period = pwm_period * 192

LED_FLASH_RATE = 2:     Led Flash Period = pwm_period * 384

LED_FLASH_RATE = 3:     Led Flash Period = pwm_period * 768

LED_FLASH_RATE = 4:     Led Flash Period = pwm_period * 1536

...

LED_FLASH_RATE = 15:    Led Flash Period = pwm_period * 3145728
