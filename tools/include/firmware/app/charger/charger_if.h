characteristics of the charger.
The "I-CTRL" values in this section should be used to set the
#CHARGER_CURRENT.

the Trickle charger voltage threshold and Float voltage are both set using

the VM application.

When in external charge mode, if the battery conditions are appropriate

On some BlueCore variants like CSRB5730, When the battery has become
fully charged, the charger will entry its STANDBY phase. During this
phase it will monitor the battery's voltage. When it drops below a
threshold, it will restart fast charging. This threshold is configured
with the STANDBY_FAST_HYSTERESIS control.
The parameter is in millivolts and describes the threshold below VFLOAT
when the charger will begin charging again.
The limits are chip dependent.
On CSRB5730, the possible values are 120mV, 258mV, 344mV and 426mV below
VFLOAT. Attempting to set a value greater than 426mV will return FALSE 
and no changes will be made to the charger. Attempting to set a value
less than 120mV will cause the hysteresis to be set to 120mV below 
VFLOAT. Other values will cause the next lowest value from the list to
be selected.
