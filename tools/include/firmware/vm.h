  @brief Removes all the advertising filters, allowing all advert reports

*/
bool VmClearAdvertisingReportFilter(void);

/*!
  @brief This helps in controlling how BlueCore filters advertising 
         report events by BLE advertising data content. 

         Filtering is based only on the contents of advertising
         data. Since directed connectable adverts do not contain advertising
         data, and they are expressly intended for the receiving device,
         they are always passed to the host and are unaffected by this
         filter. The event type, Bluetooth device address of the sender and 
         other properties of the advertising reports are ignored by the 
         filter.

         With no filter present, all advertising packets received during 
         scanning are passed to the host in LE Advertising Report Events, 
         subject to advert flood protection. The filter is used to select 
         advertising reports based on the contents of the advertising data
         (AD) and send to the host only the matching reports, thus saving
         the host being woken up unnecessarily.

  @param operation  Describes the relationship between multiple filters. 
         Currently the only valid operation is OR (0x00), meaning that 
         adverts will be sent to the host if they are matched by any of the
         filters.

  @param ad_type The AD type of the AD structure to match. The filter will 
         only match adverts containing an AD structure of this type. Enum as 
         defined in Bluetooth Assigned Numbers.

  @param interval The interval for repeated attempts to match the pattern in the 
         data portion of the AD structure. For example, if the interval is 
         4 then we attempt to match at offsets, 0, 4, 8, 12, etc in the data
         portion of the AD structure. If interval is 0 then we only attempt 
         to match at offset 0. If interval is 0xffff, then exact match is 
         required.

  @param pattern_length The length of the pattern data, i.e. number of uint8s
         pattern data present in location pointed by @a pattern_addr.

  @param pattern_addr A pointer to the location where pattern data 
         is present. Each pattern data is 8bit data and no two pattern data 
         should be packed inside uint16. BlueCore will only consider
         lower 8 bit of each pattern data for pattern matching. If 
         pattern_addr is NULL, then no pattern matching.

  @brief By default, the VM software watchdog is disabled. Calling this trap with
   a valid timeout value will initiate/reset the VM software watchdog timer.
   If the VM software watchdog timer expires, then a VM Panic will be raised 
   with Panic code VM_PANIC_SW_WD_EXPIRED and it will reset the BlueCore device.

   Whenever the VM software watchdog timer expires with the debugger attached,
   BlueCore firmware will never panic/reset the chip since it is unpredictable
   to calculate the time to extend the VM software watchdog timer due to the
   delay caused during debugging.
   
   Firmware will automatically extend the VM software watchdog timer during long
   firmware operations such as Serial flash erase, PSKey write on
   EEPROM device, so that the VM software watchdog timer is not unduly affected.

   For other operations at host which may take some time to complete, the BlueCore
   firmware does not automatically extend the VM software watchdog timer 
   because the time taken is dependent on the individual scenario with the Host.
   It is left to the application to extend/kick the VM software watchdog timer.
   As the UART Host operations are much slower than USB, it is suggested that
   longer VM software watchdog timeout values are used with UART Host operations.
   Typically, VM application is not blocked during the Host communication. During
   the Host communication, there is sufficient time left in the BlueCore firmware to
   schedule the VM application and thus, VM application can kick the VM software
   watchdog timer.

   The time taken to start the DSP application depends on the details of the 
   DSP application, which can not be predicted by the BlueCore firmware. If the 
   VM software watchdog is in use, the VM application should consider the time
   taken to start the DSP application when deciding on the timeout value. The
   BlueCore firmware will not automatically extend the timeout.

   The VM software watchdog is used to detect the misbehaving applications that have
   gone off the rails. If the BlueCore firmware disables VM software watchdog by calling
   the trap VmSoftwareWdKick() with single disable code zero, then it is possible for
   a rogue application to get there with AL set to zero (quite a common value to have
   in AL)which will disable the watchdog and prevent the system recovering. To avoid 
   this unintended behaviour and to be confident that firmware code will not disable
   the VM software watchdog even if VM application branches inappropriately, a 3-stage
   disable sequence is required.
   
   The 3-stage disable sequence to disable the VM software watchdog is as follows:
       VmSoftwareWdKick(VM_SW_WATCHDOG_DISABLE_CODE1)
       VmSoftwareWdKick(VM_SW_WATCHDOG_DISABLE_CODE2)
       VmSoftwareWdKick(VM_SW_WATCHDOG_DISABLE_CODE3)

   @param timeout The timeout period in seconds, in the range 1 to 300 or the specific
   disable codes VM_SW_WATCHDOG_DISABLE_CODE1, VM_SW_WATCHDOG_DISABLE_CODE2,
   VM_SW_WATCHDOG_DISABLE_CODE3.

   @return returns TRUE,
    1.Whenever the VM software watchdog is kicked i.e., valid range (1-300 seconds).
      Eg: VmsoftwareWDKick(20); - Returns TRUE
    2.Whenever the 3-stage disable sequence is followed as per the requirement.
    Eg: VmsoftwareWDKick(20); - Returns TRUE
        VmSoftwareWDKick(VM_SW_WATCHDOG_DISABLE_CODE1); - Returns FALSE
        VmSoftwareWDKick(VM_SW_WATCHDOG_DISABLE_CODE2); - Returns FALSE
        VmSoftwareWDKick(VM_SW_WATCHDOG_DISABLE_CODE3); - Returns TRUE
    
    returns FALSE,
    1.Whenever the VM software watchdog timeout doesn't fall under 1-300 seconds range.
    2.Whenever the VM software watchdog doesn't follow the 3-stage sequence or disabling
      the VM software watchdog fails.
    Eg: VmsoftwareWDKick(20); - Returns TRUE
        VmSoftwareWDKick(VM_SW_WATCHDOG_DISABLE_CODE2); - Returns FALSE
        VmSoftwareWDKick(VM_SW_WATCHDOG_DISABLE_CODE1); - Returns FALSE
        VmSoftwareWDKick(VM_SW_WATCHDOG_DISABLE_CODE3); - Returns FALSE

    \note
    The purpose of the 3-stage disable sequence is to ensure that rogue
    applications do not randomly disable the watchdog by kicking it with some
    single disable codes. The return value of the this trap is designed to
    indicate to the user that either the watchdog kick has succeeded due to a
    valid timeout within the specified range or that the entire 3-stage disable
    sequence has succeeded. Returning TRUE for a call on the first disable sequence
    alone would actually go against the notion that the operation of disabling the
    watchdog has succeeded. In-fact at that moment (after having kicked with the
    first disable code), there is no guarantee of whether the disabling is either
    being done deliberately (in a valid manner) or the kick has been called by
    some rouge code. Hence, unless the entire disable operation does not succeed,
    the VM must not return TRUE.
