/*! @file boot.h @brief Control booting BlueCore with different active settings
**
**
These functions control the BlueCore bootmode on unified firmware.
Each bootmode has a unique view of the persistent store,
and so a single device could boot up as (for example) an HCI dongle
using USB in one bootmode and a HID dongle using BCSP in another bootmode.
Using BootSetPreservedWord(), it is possible to store a single word of
application specific state before booting the device into
a new bootmode. Once rebooted the application can use BootGetPreservedWord().
**
The word of preserved state will only be valid (non-zero) if the device
was warm reset using BootSetMode(). As any other form of reset will
invalidate the preserved word contents and thus, BootGetPreservedWord() will return zero.
We recommend using BootSetPreservedWord() followed closely by BootSetMode()
to ensure the relevance of the preserved word contents.
VmGetResetSource() can be used to find out other causes of a reset.
**
Incorrect use of these functions could produce a non-functional module, and so caution should be exercised.
