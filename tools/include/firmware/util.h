  @param data_start The memory location of the start of the table.
  @param offset The offset into each table entry that the search will be performed at.
  @param size The size of each table entry.
  @param count The number of entries in the table.

  Conceptually we have a table in memory starting at 'data_start', with 'count' entries where each entry is 'size'.
  UtilFind searches for 'value', at 'offset' from the start of each entry, using bitmask 'mask'.

  @return VM address of the table entry containing 'value' if found, else 0.

  @param end The 'end' of the string to convert.
  @param result Will contain the resulting number.
  @return A pointer into the string (the first character after
  the number) unless no number was found, in which case 0 is returned.

  Note that the string converted here will not include the character pointed to by 'end'.
  That is, to convert the string "123" you would need to call 'UtilGetNumber(start, start+3, &result)'.

  The number is expected to be an unsigned decimal in the range 0 to 2^16-1.
