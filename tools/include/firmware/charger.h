  @param value Which value to use

  Consult the datasheet for your BlueCore variant and the documentation for the
  #charger_config_key type for more information.

/*!
    @brief Enables charger events and configures their debouncing.
    @param events_to_enable Each bit position enables a charger event. See the
           #charger_events enum for details of the events.
    @param count The number of times to read from the charger pins before notifying the application
    @param period The delay in milliseconds between reads.

    A #MESSAGE_CHARGER_CHANGED message will be delivered to the task setup by MessageChargerTask()
    when the debounced state of the charger pins has changed.

    For example calling ChargerDebounce((CHARGER_VREG_EVENT | CHARGER_CONNECT_EVENT), 4, 1000)
    will enable the VREGEN_H and the charger attach/detach events. The application will
    receive a #MESSAGE_CHARGER_CHANGED message after the charger pins value has changed and then 
    remained stable for 4 consecutive reads 1000 milliseconds apart. 
    For CSR8670 or CSR8670-like chips this same call would also enable a #MESSAGE_CHARGER_CHANGED
    message to be received when VREG_EN has been detected pressed for four consecutive readings,
    each 1000mS apart.
    
    @return A charger_events bit mask where any bit set high indicates an invalid event bit 
    passed in the "events_to_enable" parameter. Any invalid event will result in the ChargerDebounce()
    request being rejected. Returns 0 on success.
